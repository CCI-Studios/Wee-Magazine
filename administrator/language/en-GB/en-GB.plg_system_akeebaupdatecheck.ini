PLG_AKEEBAUPDATECHECK_EMAIL_IMPORTANTNOTES="----------\n*** IMPORTANT NOTES ***\n1. The link above will automatically log you in to your web site under your Super Administrator account and run Akeeba Backup's update process, without asking for a username or password. This link is active for 24 hours and can only be used ONCE. Once you visit it, it becomes inactive; visiting it again has no effect. If you have some form of back-end password protection, the link may not work. In that case, you can log in to your site manually and follow our usual update instructions which can be found in our documentation.\n2. This email and this one-time login link was sent to you BY A PLUGIN RUNNING ON YOUR OWN SITE, not the developers of Akeeba Backup or any other party affiliated with or endorsed by AkeebaBackup.com. AkeebaBackup.com DOES NOT collect installed version information, DOES NOT share your personal or contact information, DOES NOT send out emails about new updates to its subscribers, DOES NOT have access to your website, DOES NOT know your Super Administrator username/password and DOES NOT know the domain name of your site. You have received this email FROM SOFTWARE RUNNING ON YOUR OWN SITE because you activated this feature during Akeeba Backup's first run, by clicking on a check box with a clear explanation of how this feature works printed under it.\n3. If you wish to stop receiving such emails from your site due to security concerns, DO NOT ask AkeebaBackup.com to disable those emails, or remove you from any mailing list, because there is NO mailing list. You have to disable a plugin ON YOUR SITE. As written above, AkeebaBackup.com DOES NOT have access to your site, therefore can not disable that plugin for you. All you have to do is to please disable the ''Akeeba Backup Update Notification'' plugin on your site by going to the Extensions, Plugin Manager menu item on your site's back-end, find the plugin in question and unpublish it.\n----------"
